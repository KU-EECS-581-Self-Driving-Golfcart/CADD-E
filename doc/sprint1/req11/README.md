In the model predictive control framework, choosing the type of model relates to the type of problem being solved. In our case, using a state space model is appropriate because there exist useful models for the dynamics of automobiles. In the literature, the point-mass model, the nonlinear four wheel model, the nonlinear bicycle model, and the linear bicycle model have all been used as models for cars in the MPC framework. See Gao 2014 for reference.
