Caden,

 

My schedule is pretty terrible for next couple of weeks.  Can you and your team do a zoom Saturday morning at 9:30 or 10:30?  Sunday morning is also possible.

Dr. McClendon,

 

My name is Caden Kroonenberg, I have just started my senior year as a Computer Science student at KU. As such, I have begun working on my capstone project with a group of other students. We are designing a self-driving golf cart that can autonomously navigate a pre-mapped cart path for eighteen holes, with minimal passenger input. We are still early in the design process so lots of the details have yet to be ironed out.




Given your experience, our group was hoping to speak with you about the design process: potential pitfalls, general advice, etc. Are you available to meet anytime this upcoming week to discuss this project?




Furthermore, a few of our group members (myself included) are excited to attend the startup school to explore the business potential that self driving golf carts may hold.




Best,




Caden Kroonenberg
