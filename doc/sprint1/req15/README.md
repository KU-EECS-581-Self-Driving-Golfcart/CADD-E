The Apollo autonomous vehicle stack is a completely open source software that can be used to make a self-driving car. Brian McClendon originially suggested that we take a look at the stack to see if any of the code would be useful to us. While the overall structure diagram was helpful to view, the team decided that the underlying hardware was just too different to try and duplicate the stack.
