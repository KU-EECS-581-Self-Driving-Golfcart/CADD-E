# Requirement 2
## Update DeepRacer mount to include radar and camera mounts

To satisfy this requirement, I updated the DeepRacer mount I drafted in a previous sprint to include mounts for the camera and ultrasonic sensors.

The vertical face has threaded holes to mount the camera, surrounded by two ultrasonic sensors. The horizontal face has 4 holes to sit on the canopy mounts of the DeepRacer and threaded holes to mount the IMU, GPS sensor, and GPS antenna. The rectangular hole in the horizontal face is to pass the camera's ribbon wire from the camera to the Raspberry Pi, which will sit under the mount, strapped onto the DeepRacer with a velcro strap.

Here is a screenshot of the new model:
