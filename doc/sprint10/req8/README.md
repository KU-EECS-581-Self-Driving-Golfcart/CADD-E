I re-took measurements to calibrate the low-level speed controller, and changed the design so it was easier to control (changed the control variable from acceleration to speed). I came up with a plan for reducing the error in lateral movement, which on the deepracer is significant (tracking with PID controller).

Unfortunately, I was not able to implement these because on Sunday the deepracer stopped booting. I was not able to boot into recovery mode for some reason, so I was unable to flash a recovery drive.

Unable to check out a deepracer until next week, I directly took the step to email Prof. Mohammed Alian to obtain a mini-car as used in the 388 labs. He forwarded my email to the appropriate professor and I am waiting to hear back.

If I don't hear back within the next day, I will inquire with Prof. Heechul Yun about the DeepPiCar, which his graduate students use for DNN training demonstrations.
