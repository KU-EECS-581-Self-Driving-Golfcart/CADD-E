# Requirement 4
## Upgrade DeepRacer to Ubuntu 20 / ROS2

Following [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deepracer/latest/developerguide/deepracer-ubuntu-update.html) from AWS, I was able to upgrade the DeepRacer to Ubuntu 20. One key thing that AWS didn't mention in their docs is that the device which you boot from must be 32GB or the process will not work.
