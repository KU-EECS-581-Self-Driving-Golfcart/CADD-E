This requirement involved running CARLA and interfacing with ROS using carla's ROS bridge module. I need more time on this deliverable because I haven't had access to a computer with the graphics capabilities to run CARLA. Since CARLA is only available on windows/linux I tried to use my older Dell laptop to run it, but it didn't have sufficient graphics capabilities and CARLA only crashed on startup. I'll look into using the lab computers, but I need to ask Engineering tech support about installing software since users can't install software by default.
