Instead of spending time learning advanced graphics modeling software to create a photorealistic model of the cart, I decided it was appropriate to use a normal car model, already included in CARLA, to model the car, since the dynamics are similar and we're primarily testing the reaction to unexpected events by the motion control software. If we were focused on handling the golf cart at the limits of its ability, an exact dynamic model might be required, but in our case, it is not.
