I read through multiple published papers on determining an object's orientation based on video / static images. The two most helpful links were from [Named Link](https://repository.stcloudstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&context=csit_etds "Cloud State") and [Named Link](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA149980 "Defence Technical Information Center"). Caden and I are playing on using this task for our data science project.
