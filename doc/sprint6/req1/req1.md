# Req1
I implemented the simulink model shown in m1.png, which presents a simplified version of the previously designed architecture. The model is simplified by decoupling the steering and throttle  controls. This lets us create a quick MVP which we can use on the deepracer and iterate on.

The model currently presents an inscrutable data type error. I have reached out to a professor in the aerospace department for help with the model, and will fix this error in the next sprint.
