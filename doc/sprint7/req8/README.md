The objective of requirement eight was to generate code from the simulink model. I was able to begin the code generation process, but found actually generating the code could only be done after making changes to the model. The main addition I need to make before performing code generation is to implement ROS message reading. The model should take inputs from ROS about the data being perceived by the sensors instead of generating the data itself. I will accomplish this in the next sprint.
