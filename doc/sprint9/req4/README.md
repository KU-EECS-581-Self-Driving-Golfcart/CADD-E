# Requirement 4
## R-Tree closest node testing

To satisfy this requirement, I inserted the nodes from the adjacency list created in Requirement 5 to the R Tree data structure I implemented in Sprint 8.

I implemented a new algorithm for the R Tree to search the tree for the closest point within the tree to a query location. Using this, we may provide a GPS location and the algorithm will return the closest point to our location.
