We will use model predictive control to perform path replanning and tracking in our golf cart. Model predictive control is well-suited to our particular problem because it is well-suited for following a predefined trajectory, ie the pre-mapped cart path, and has been well-researched for autonomous driving applications. Our initial architecture document explains model predictive control and gives references for research on its use in self-driving cars. The use of MPC in our case instead of a combinational planning method is the clear implementation: once we define the optimal control problem, we can use an existing optimization library to implement the solver. Also, we don't need pre-defined motion primitives.
