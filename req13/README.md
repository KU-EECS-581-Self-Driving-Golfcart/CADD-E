YOLO (You only look once) is an out of the box model that can beused for real-time object detection. A smaller model, specifially YOLO-tiny is designed to work on embedded systems like a raspberry pi. The team found multiple examples of tutorials of how to configure the raspberry pi to detect objects. While completing this research, many tutorials recommended a google coral in order to accerlate the prediction times. Even though the coral is not critial to the project's completion, it will make the vision software run much smoother.
