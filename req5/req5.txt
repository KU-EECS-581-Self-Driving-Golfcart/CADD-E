OpenStreetMap's map system is topological, meaning it is implemented with a graph data structure. Nodes are connected by edges to form the map.

Each node is a point-shaped geometric element.
Nodes contain information like an ID value as well as latitude, longitude, and a series of other information called "tags". 
Nodes may be interconnected by "ways".

Ways model line-shaped geometric objects (roads, paths, etc.)
Ways contain information like an ID, a layer (relevant for highways which go over other roads, etc.), a set of nodes representing the geometry of the way, and a set of tags.

Tags contain other relevant information like:
A node description (streetlight, building, etc.)
Road speed limit
Road width
Etc.
